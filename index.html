      I'm writing this to make a point. You'll see. However I'm desperately
      afraid that I won't find the right words to make that point. You'll see.
      I'm afraid that all of the acrobatics of the medium, all the posturing and
      pomp will be lost in the vacuousness of the words themselves. I'm also
      slightly nervous that everyone will see through this rather thin attempt
      to rip off Austin Kleon. He is the one who said "steal like an artist"
      after all and I can't help but wonder how many people went right to his
      own jugular after that comment and ripped him off wholesale.
